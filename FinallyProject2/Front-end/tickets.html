                                Lapland is an immersive theatrical experience. Like any theatre experience, each tour
                                has a strict limit on the number of adults and children, and this cannot be exceeded.
                                This is because each family requires their own seating, and each child requires a
                                dedicated workbench to take part in the activities in both the Toy Factory and Mother
                                Christmas’ Kitchen.</p>

                                groups- ‘Team Reindeer’ and ‘Team Husky.’ If you and another family are booked on the

                                You have a legal right to change your mind and receive a refund within 14 days of when

                            <p>LaplandUK has partnered with TicketPlan to offer cancellation protection as part of your
                                booking, subject to a fee. We strongly recommend that you include this option when
                                making your booking, as this will protect you against being unable to attend due to
                                accidents and unexpected illnesses – this includes COVID-19 related illness. Full
                                details are included in the TicketPlan terms and conditions which we advise you to read
                                and retain. <br> <br>

                                By purchasing TicketPlan Cancellation Protection, your tickets are refundable subject to
                                the terms and conditions of TicketPlan. Please note that the cancellation protection fee
                                is non-refundable, this includes being unable to attend due to the cancellation of the
                                event. <br> <br>

                                The booking fee attached to your booking is also non-refundable under any circumstances,
                                including being unable to attend due to the cancellation of the event. <br> <br>

                                Please note your booking will not be covered should you be unable to attend the event
                                due to Government restrictions or advice should LaplandUK remain open. <br> <br>

                                TicketPlan Cancellation Protection is only able to be purchased at the time of booking.
                                You will not be able to add it to your booking retrospectively. <br> <br>
